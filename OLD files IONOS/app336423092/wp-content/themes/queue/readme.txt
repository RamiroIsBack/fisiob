== Description ==

Queue is a highly responsive theme designed with meticulous typography, tasteful details, and the ability to maximize screen space. 

Some of the more notable features:

*	Featured posts can be displayed on the home page in a dynamic grid layout that responds to viewport size to make best use of the available space. Featured posts are controlled by a user-customizable tag that can optionally be hidden to the public.
*	Option to display custom copy in the footer of the home page.
*	Customizable accent color.
*	Two menus available.

== Notes ==

*	Featured Images are displayed in the featured post grid on the home page and not when viewing single posts.
*	Multi-level menus are visually flattened for presentation.
